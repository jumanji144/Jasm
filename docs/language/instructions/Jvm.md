# JVM Instruction set
The jvm instruction set for jasm 

## Objects
Objects used by the jvm instruction set

### Variable
A variable is a label for a local variable which can also be a parameter.
It can be represented by the following expressions:
- any identifier
- any number

Important: In order to make sure obfuscation does not break jasm, number literals are **interpreted as identifiers**. This means that `astore 2` does NOT store the top object to the variable in slot `2`, but stores it to a variable CALLED `2`. It does not have to be variable 2.
There is currently no way to load / store a specific local index.

### Constant
A constant is a object present in the constant pool and can be represented by the following expressions:
- identifier:
  - class type (`Lsome/package/Class;` `[Lsome/package/Array` `[I` `I`)
  - a method type (`(Lsome/package/Argument;IIJJZZ)Lsome/package/Return;`)
- number:
    represents a numeric constant, depending on context only certain number kinds are allowed
- string:
    a string constant
- array:
    - handle:
        The jvm takes the [handle](#handle) and resolves it to a MethodHandle
    - constant dynamic: The jvm evaluates the constant dynamic using the handle to resolve a method handle and then invokes it

### Handle
Format:
```
{ kind, owner.member, descriptor }
```      
A handle is a way to describe a way for the jvm to obtain a `java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle` from the instructions given.
The way the jvm obtains this is determined by the kind:
- invokevirtual (equivalent to: `invokevirtual owner.member descriptor`)
- invokestatic (equivalent to: `invokestatic owner.member descriptor`)
- invokespecial (equivalent to: `invokespecial owner.member descriptor`)
- getfield (equivalent to: `getfield owner.member descriptor`)
- putfield (equivalent to: `putfield owner.member descriptor`)
- getstatic (equivalent to: `getstatic owner.member descriptor`)
- putstatic (equivalent to: `putstatic owner.member descriptor`)
- invokeinterface (equivalent to: `invokeinterface owner.member descriptor`)
- newinvokespecial (equivalent to: `new owner; dup; invokespecial owner.<init> descriptor`

### Constant dynamic
Format:
```
{ name, descriptor { kind, owner.member, descriptor } { arguments } }
```
Constant dynamic is the constant equivalent of the [invokedynamic](#invokedynamic) instruction, as it evaluates the same
but counts as a constant, thus can be used in any other place a constant of its type is permitted.

It behaves the same as a invokedynamic instruction, but evaluates the value directly in place, instead of on the stack

### Tableswitch
Format:
```
{ 
    default: label,
    min: int,
    max: int,
    cases: { label... }
}
```
A tableswitch is a way to jump to a label based on a integer value, it takes an integer and jumps to the label at the
index of the integer in the cases array, if the integer is less than min or greater than max it jumps to the default
label.

### Lookupswitch
Format:
```
{ 
    default: label,
    cases: { 
        key: label,
        ...
    }
}
```
A lookupswitch is a way to jump to a label based on a integer value, it takes an integer and jumps to the label at the
key in the cases array, if the integer is not present in the cases array it jumps to the default label.

### Array Type
Array type specifies the primitive type of the array, it can be one of the following:
- `byte`
- `short`
- `char`
- `int`
- `long`
- `float`
- `double`
- `boolean`
